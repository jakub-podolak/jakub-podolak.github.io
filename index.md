# ✨ You've discovered my secret hideout! ✨

Hey there! It seems like everyone in Machine Learning has a cool website showcasing their projects - so here’s mine, partly to fit in, and partly because I seriously need some motivation to document what I'm actually doing 😅

## 😄 About Me

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Warsaw, and I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. I have industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist - check out my [LinkedIn] if you want to know more.

## 🔬 Research and Publications

- **Podolak**, Łukasik, Balawender, Ossowski, Piotrowski, Bąkowicz, Sankowski,
  [LLM generated responses to mitigate the impact of hate speech], **EMNLP Findings 2024**

- **Podolak**, [When and Why Do Uncertainty Quantification Methods for LLMs Work?], Ongoing Master Thesis @ University of Amsterdam, 2025

## 🧑‍🎨 Projects and Blogposts

- 🖼️ [qr2o: Virtual Grafitti Wall], 2024, Together with friends, we built a digital alternative to doodling on toilet walls. Now you can leave your mark digitally by scanning a unique QR code linked to a physical location (most likely a toilet).

- 📅 [Co-organizing ML in PL Conference], 2022 - 2024, For 3 years I co-organized one of the biggest (and coolest) machine learning events in Poland. In 2024 I was honoured to co-lead the whole event together with my friend - still can't believe we pulled it off!

- ⌚ [Trying to build a DIY Smartwatch], 2018 - ?, Also known as the perfect excuse to buy a 3D printer and learn PCB design. Check out the progress through five (and counting!) iterations of the watch.

- 👾 [The Purple Ship, Developing a mobile arcade game], 2020, I created a simple mobile game in Godot and published it on the Play Store. Spoiler alert: It didn't make me rich.
